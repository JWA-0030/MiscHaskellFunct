Create a function named multiples. You will solve this with a list comprehension. The function will take a single argument named maxNumber. The function will go through all numbers from 1 to maxNumber. If a number is a multiple of 5 and 7, then it will be added to the list.

multiples 100
[35,70]

Next create a function named doubleAll. You will solve this with a list comprehension. The function will take a single argument named maxNumber. The function will go though all numbers from 1 to maxNumber, double them, and put them into a list.

doubleAll 100
[2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20,22,24,26,28,30,32,34,36,38,40,42,44,46,48,50,52,54,56,58,60,62,64,66,68,70,72,74,76,78,80,82,84,86,88,90,92,94,96,98,100,102,104,106,108,110,112,114,116,118,120,122,124,126,128,130,132,134,136,138,140,142,144,146,148,150,152,154,156,158,160,162,164,166,168,170,172,174,176,178,180,182,184,186,188,190,192,194,196,198,200]

Finally create a function named squareEvens. You will solve this with a list comprehension. The function will take a single argument named maxNumber. The function will go through all numbers from 1 to maxNumber, and if a number is even, it will be squared and added to a list.

squareEvens 50
[4,16,36,64,100,144,196,256,324,400,484,576,676,784,900,1024,1156,1296,1444,1600,1764,1936,2116,2304,2500]
